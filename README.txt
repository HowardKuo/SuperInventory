Our project is based on developing an inventory database.  There are several options that the 
manager can choose from the project.  

The manager can:
• Insert the inventory’s information 
• Edit the inventory’s information
• Delete the inventory’s information
• View all the inventories.

When the manager inserts an inventory’s information, it would require inserting the:
• Name
• Category 
• Price
• Quantity 

When the manager is finish inserting the inventory’s information, the information would be 
transfer straight into the database (not actually implemented).  Now, the manager can 
edit, delete, or view the information that he or she has inserted into the database.
If the manager wants to edit an inventory, he or she can choose a number “edit an item” 
from the menu list, and then choose the item that he or she wants to edit.

Likewise, the manager can choose a number “delete an item” from the menu list if he or she 
wants to delete something from the inventory database.  After deleting an item, the manager 
can view all inventories and will notice that the item has been deleted.

The 2 most difficult situations we had with our project was having the search function find 
multiple items. Deleting an item was also a little weird to us. When we delete an item, it 
would show an error.  It was telling us that there are empty slots in our inventory database.  
Fortunately, we were able to fix that by coding the total inventory, telling it to subtract that 
slot from the list when it is deleted.

The thing that we would have done differently is that we would want to make our project a 
universal search function, which we weren’t able to do.  If we had more time,
 we would have liked to have created the actual database.
